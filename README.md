# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign Dataset

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to determine how various fund raising campaign fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. The analysis was performed using the kickstarter data set which contained a list of goal and pledged amounts, outcomes, categories, and launch date, for each campaign in a tabulated form. In particular, the analysis was performed to determine the outcome of the campagn in theater category based on their launch date, and the outcome of campaign in a play subcategory based on goal amount.



## Analysis and Challenges
### 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It is observed that the theater campaigns that were launched in the month of May was the most succesful, and those launched in the month of December were least successful.
The number of campaign that failed were on and averge pretty steady over the period of year. 
There were very few campaign that were canceled in this category

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The funding for the play category shows 73 - 76% success rate for funding of less than $5000. It also shows a success rate of 67% for fundings between $35000 - $45000.
The succes rate was the lowest for funds above $45000 (less than 13%).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   The funding for the theater category is most likely to be more successful if launched in the second or third quarter of the year.
   The funding for the theater category is least likely to be successful if launced in the fourth quarter of the year.
   
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   The play subcategory campaign with goal amount less than $5000 is more likely to be successful. Although the data shows that some play with a funding bettween $35000 - $45000 may be somewhat successful.
   But, those campaign with goal amount above $45000 are most lokely to fail. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
   The data probably has some outliers that needs to be sorted out and taken care of.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
